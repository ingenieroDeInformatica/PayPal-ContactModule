Open a new terminal and run "npm install" then run "rpm run start"

within this section of server.js
...(includeShipping && { // If we want to include shipping...
                      // RETAIN only works if you include both emailAddress and phoneNumber below
                        shipping: {
                        // emailAddress:
                        //         "buyer_shipping_email@example.com", // Include this to make it uneditable in Retain contact module
                            phoneNumber: {
                                countryCode: "1",
                                nationalNumber: "4081111111",
                            },



If you don't pass the emailAddress or phoneNumber, you will be allowed to edit it, even if you put "RETAIN_CONTACT_INFO"
